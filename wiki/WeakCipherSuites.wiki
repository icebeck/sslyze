#summary Testing for weak cipher suites.

= Description =

OpenSSL Weak cipher suites


= Detection = 

Insecure cipher suites being enabled is a classic SSL misconfiguration. A properly hardened server should NOT accept the following: 
 * Any cipher suite that has a key size smaller than 128 bits. 
 * Any anonymous cipher suite, because they don't provide server authentication. SSLyze will flag them as "Anon".
 * Any cipher suite that is part of the SSLv2 protocol, because the protocol itself is broken.

= Recommendations =

Disable SSLv2, cipher suites with a key size smaller than 128 bits, and anonymous cipher suites.
