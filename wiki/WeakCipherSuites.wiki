#summary Testing for weak cipher suites.

= Description =

Insecure cipher suites being enabled on the server is a classic SSL misconfiguration. 

The version 2 of SSL is a completely broken as a protocol, and allows for cryptographic downgrade attacks. 
Within SSL 3 and TLS 1, weak cipher suites being enabled on the server could potentially allow attackers to easily brute-force the keys used to encrypt the SSL traffic between a client and the server, allowing them to subvert the confidentiality of the clientâ€™s session traffic. 

= Detection = 
SSLyze can scan the server in order to detect which cipher suites it supports within the SSL 2.0 , SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 protocols.

= Recommendations =

A properly hardened server should NOT accept the following cipher suites: 
 * Any cipher suite that has a key size smaller than 128 bits. 
 * Any anonymous cipher suite, because they don't provide server authentication. SSLyze will flag them as "Anon".
 * Any cipher suite that is part of the SSLv2 protocol, because the protocol itself is broken.
