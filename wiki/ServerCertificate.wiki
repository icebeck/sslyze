#summary Checking the server certificate's validity.

= Description =
For a given server, its SSL certificate can be invalid for various reasons. An invalid certificate greatly threatens the security of any SSL connection with the server, because the server is not properly authenticated. For example, when the client is a browser, it usually forces the user to accept a security warning when connecting to the server, meaning that a network attacker could easily masquerade as the server and prompt its own, invalid certificate to the client, that would prompt the same warning. 



= Detection =

SSLyze can verify the server's certificate validity against Mozilla's trusted root store, and print relevant fields of the certificate.

= Recommendations =
Here is a non exhaustive list of recommendations regarding the validity of the server's certificate:
 * The subject CN within the certificate should match the server's hostname.
 * The certificate should not be expired.
 * Key size should be 2048 bits or larger.
 * The signature algorithm should not be MD5 or MD2.
