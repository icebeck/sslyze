#summary Testing for susceptibility to THC's SSL DOS attack.

= Description =
THC has released a DOS tool that exploits SSL renegotiation to perform a denial of service on a given SSL server. See http://www.thc.org/thc-ssl-dos/



= Detection =

The current version of THC's SSL DOS tool requires the server to honor client-initiated renegotiations in order to work.

 {{{ $ python sslyze.py --reneg www.server.com:443 }}}

= Recommandation =
A migitation against THC's SSL DOS tool is to prevent the server from honoring client-initiated renegotiations.
As explained on their website, "The tool can be modified to work
without SSL-RENEGOTIATION by just establishing a new TCP connection for every
new handshake.".
