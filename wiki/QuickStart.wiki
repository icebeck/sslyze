=Installation=
Supported platforms are Windows 7 and Linux, both 32 and 64 bits. Mac OS X is not officially supported yet.

== Linux ==
Python 2.6 or 2.7 and OpenSSL 0.9.8+ is needed. 
 * [http://XXX.com Package is here].

== Windows ==
Only Python 2.6 or 2.7 is needed. OpenSSL 1.0.0c is part of the installation package.
 * [http://XXX.com Package for Python 32 bits].
 * [http://XXX.com Package for Python 64 bits].


=Usage=
The following command line can be used:

 {{{ $ python main.py [options] www.target1.com www.target2.com:443 etc... }}}

== Options ==
Several command line options are available:

=== Regular Scan "--regular" ===
Performs a regular scan. It's a shortcut for "--sslv2 --sslv3 --tlsv1 --reneg --resum --certinfo=basic".


=== OpenSSL Cipher Suites "--sslv2", "--sslv3", "--tlsv1"=== 
Lists the SSL 2.0 / SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0 OpenSSL cipher suites supported by the server. 


===Session Renegotiation "--reneg"===
Checks whether the server is vulnerable to insecure renegotiation. 


===Session Resumption "--resum"=== 
Tests the server for session resumption support, using both session IDs and TLS session tickets (RFC 5077). 

===Session Resumption Rate "--resum_rate"=== 
Estimates the average rate of successful session resumptions by performing 100 session resumptions. 

===Server Certificate "--certinfo=basic"=== 
Verifies the server's certificate validity against Mozilla's trusted root store, and prints relevant fields of the certificate.

== Additional Options ==

=== Client Certificate Support ===
Configures SSlyze to use a client certificate in case the server performs mutual authentication. The following options are required:
 * --cert=CERT           Client certificate filename.
 * --certform=CERTFORM   Client certificate format. DER or PEM (default).
 * --key=KEY             Client private key filename.
 * --keyform=KEYFORM     Client private key format. DER or PEM (default).
 * --pass=KEYPASS        Client private key passphrase.


=== Connections Timeout "--timeout=TIMEOUT"=== 
Sets the timeout value in seconds used for every socket connection made to the target server(s). It forces SSLyze to wait more (or less) time for the target server to respond. Default value is 5s.
